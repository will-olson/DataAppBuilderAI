# 🚀 Sigma Compatibility Roadmap
## Bridging the Gap to True Sigma Platform Integration

*This document outlines the current implementation gaps and development roadmap to transform GrowthMarketer AI into a true Sigma-compatible playground where developers and data engineers can build data applications that can be directly imported into Sigma's platform.*

---

## 🎯 **Current State vs. Sigma Platform Reality**

### **What We Have (Current Implementation)**
- ✅ Basic Sigma framework structure with three operational modes
- ✅ Skeleton implementations of Sigma components (Input Tables, Layout Elements, Actions)
- ✅ Mode switching between standalone, mock warehouse, and Sigma integration
- ✅ Basic API endpoints that mirror Sigma's structure
- ✅ Frontend components that render Sigma-like interfaces

### **What Sigma Actually Provides (Target Capabilities)**
- 🔴 **Workbooks as Code**: Full Sigma workbook definitions in YAML/JSON format
- 🔴 **Data Source Integration**: Native connections to cloud data warehouses
- 🔴 **Element Library**: Complete set of interactive visualizations and controls
- 🔴 **Action Framework**: Rich event handling and data manipulation capabilities
- 🔴 **Governance & Security**: Role-based access control and data policies
- 🔴 **Deployment Pipeline**: CI/CD integration for workbook deployment

---

## 🚧 **Critical Implementation Gaps**

### **1. Sigma Workbook Definition Format**
**Current Gap**: We have basic component structures but lack the complete Sigma workbook schema.

**What Needs to Be Implemented**:
```yaml
# Example Sigma workbook structure we need to support
workbook:
  name: "Marketing Analytics Dashboard"
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: "Comprehensive marketing performance insights"
  
  data_sources:
    - name: "user_events"
      type: "snowflake"
      connection: "marketing_warehouse"
      schema: "analytics"
      table: "user_events"
      
  elements:
    - type: "table"
      name: "user_metrics"
      data_source: "user_events"
      columns:
        - name: "user_id"
          type: "string"
        - name: "conversion_rate"
          type: "number"
          format: "percentage"
          
  actions:
    - name: "filter_by_date"
      type: "filter"
      target: "user_metrics"
      parameters:
        - name: "start_date"
          type: "date"
        - name: "end_date"
          type: "date"
```

**Implementation Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - This is the foundation for true compatibility

---

### **2. Data Source Integration Layer**
**Current Gap**: Mock warehouse mode only simulates data, doesn't provide real warehouse connectivity.

**What Needs to Be Implemented**:
- **Connection Management**: Support for Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks
- **Schema Discovery**: Automatic table and column detection
- **Query Optimization**: SQL generation and execution planning
- **Data Preview**: Real-time data sampling and validation

**Implementation Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Without real data, this is just a mockup

---

### **3. Sigma Element Library**
**Current Gap**: Basic UI components that look like Sigma but lack the full functionality.

**What Needs to Be Implemented**:
- **Visualization Components**:
  - Charts: Line, Bar, Scatter, Pie, Heatmap, Box Plot
  - Tables: Pivot tables, cross-tabs, drill-down capabilities
  - Controls: Date pickers, dropdowns, sliders, search boxes
  - Layout: Containers, tabs, modals, responsive grids
  
- **Interactive Features**:
  - Drill-down capabilities
  - Cross-filtering between elements
  - Dynamic formatting based on data values
  - Conditional styling and visibility

**Implementation Priority**: 🟡 **HIGH** - Core user experience depends on this

---

### **4. Action Framework**
**Current Gap**: Basic action definitions without execution logic.

**What Needs to Be Implemented**:
- **Event Handling**: Click, hover, selection, filter events
- **Data Operations**: Filter, sort, aggregate, transform
- **Navigation**: Page transitions, modal opens, tab switching
- **External Integrations**: API calls, webhook triggers, email notifications

**Implementation Priority**: 🟡 **HIGH** - Actions make dashboards interactive

---

### **5. Governance & Security Model**
**Current Gap**: No role-based access control or data policies.

**What Needs to Be Implemented**:
- **User Management**: Roles, permissions, groups
- **Data Access Control**: Row-level security, column masking
- **Audit Logging**: User actions, data access, changes
- **Compliance**: GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA support

**Implementation Priority**: 🟠 **MEDIUM** - Required for enterprise adoption

---

### **6. Deployment & CI/CD Integration**
**Current Gap**: No way to export or deploy workbooks to Sigma.

**What Needs to Be Implemented**:
- **Export Formats**: Sigma-compatible YAML/JSON, Sigma CLI commands
- **Version Control**: Git integration, branching, merging
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated testing, staging, production deployment
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Version management and recovery

**Implementation Priority**: 🟠 **MEDIUM** - Essential for production workflows
